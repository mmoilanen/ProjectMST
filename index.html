					<p> My name is Mary. I am fostering Dixie the rat terrier mix and her puppies through Animal Humane Society. </p>
				<article>
					<p> I brough Dixie to my house while she was still pregnant. Her puppies were born at my house on Saturday, July 16. They are <em>healthy</em> and <em>happy</em> and <strong>growing up so fast!</strong> </p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p> Marigold is the oldest of the three, and the only girl. Beauregard was next, and he was by far the tiniest of the pups. Chester was the last puppy born and had the cutest little speckles on his nose. </p>
